## Application Area Review

Decentralized cryptocurrencies have emerged vastly in the past decade. Many cryptocurrencies including the founder Bitcoin, provides the owner a direct approach to online payments without centralised financial payments, for example a credit card (Marr). Furthermore, crypto has widely become a financial asset rather than just a tool for online transactions, therefore there are a mass number of trades being executed on multiple exchange platforms. Similar to stock exchange trading, crypto faces similar challenges such as, fraud, volatility prediction and price prediction. Despite the initial assessment, cryptocurrency brings new challenges for instance, privacy and anonymity, blockchain and cybersecurity as well as crypto mining (IBM).

Passionate or dedicated crypto blockchain investors could use algorithmic trading to improve their chances by purchasing and selling their assets at the right time for financial gains. Artificial intelligence in cryptocurrency provides accuracy to investment predictions with minimal margin for error as AI can assist with sentiment analysis, improved monetization, and automated trading strategies (Pati). Sentiment analysis grants the AI system to evaluate the public’s opinion and using this data collected from articles, blogs, social media, news, and other platforms to mathematically examine data to find positive and negative sentiment. These sentiments can allow AI to anticipate confident and unfavourable decisions (TechTarget Contributor). The improvement in monetization allows the AI to use crypto strategy to determine its most optimal outcomes by suggesting a superior profitable investment. Automated Crypto Strategy gives AI systems a discerning approach to analyse a mass amount of data within a short period of time, in addition the use of algorithms to predict and implement personal strategies including automatic trading, this has proven to provide a substantial profit for investors (McNamara).

### Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis is a statistical method to identify patterns and trends in the data and subsequently make future predictions. Time series can be found in a variety of categories including finance, engineering, and atmospheric sciences. Patterns and trends in crypto prices, marketing data, and the history of weather forecast data are among many types of data collected over time. The participation of Time series statistical techniques will aid predictions based on past values and observations (Hayes). One of the most common types of time series statistical test is the Dicky-Fuller test, it is used to determine if the unit root exists in the data sample. A unit root can alter the properties including the autocorrelation and variance of time series. The DF test is conducted to examine whether if the null hypothesis holds a unit root, if there are no null hypothesis, it can be determined the time series is stationary, therefore there are no changes to the mean and variance in the data over time. It is usually good practice to check if the data is stationary before implementing time series (Prabhakaran). There are many different time series models which can be used for crypto trading, this includes Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and seasonal decomposition models (Chao).

### Neural Networks

A neural network is one of many subcategories of machine learning, the learning model is inspired by the function and structure of the human brain. It is assembled with multiple layers of neurons, which develops and relay information. Neural networks can be used in algorithmic trading to predict future crypto prices or other financial markets, this means the AI can self-learn in order to make optimal decisions on buying and selling (Vonko). There are several choices when it comes to neural network implementation for cryptography, this includes Feed forward neural networks, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) among many other choices for cryptography. Feed forward NN, are considered to have the basic structure of neural networks because, they consist of an input layer, at least one or more hidden layers and lasty an output layer. The input data inserted will be modified and connected to the hidden layer before being exported (Great Learning Team).

### Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis also known as opinion mining is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP), this contains AI techniques to interpret and understand humans. There are several approach using sentiment analysis such as, Rule based, machine learning or hybrid. Rule based will consider specific words or sentences, machine learning will be educated in a large data structure and determine if they are positive or negative, the hybrid approach is the mix of both models. The use of Sentiment analysis in cryptography gathers data from social media, news, and other sources of communication and understanding the vast public opinion. Public opinion matters in crypto; the more people are talking into buying a particular blockchain network, the likelihood of the market fluctuating to a profitable gain would be a fair assessment (Wang).

### Bayesian Networks

A Bayesian Network has the ability to show the probability between a set of variables in a directed acyclic graph (DAGs). Most notably, the Bayesian network could be used to predict the likelihood of disease and early diagnosis (Collins and Fenton). The probabilistic use of Bayesian network often found in uncertainty including the human knowledge, therefore this is one of the most common models to find an outcome from incomplete data in an adaptable and efficient procedure. Algorithmic trading using Bayesian network allows the user to find a prediction from the AI on where the market is fluctuating given the specific market data or overall market condition (Tripathi and Kumar Sharma).

## Compare and Evaluate AI Techniques

### Time Series Analysis

There are several sources for time series data for cryptocurrencies for both API’s and CSV format. Some of the popular API’s include Bitquery, QuickNode and CoinMarketCap API (ShrimpyApp), alternatively a CSV format can be downloaded from websites such as, Yahoo Finance where you can download market data in a specific starting and ending date. For example, the user is able to select the starting date as launch date and the ending date as today, downloading this data in CSV will draw all the data information including, date, open, high, low, close, adj close and volume (Yahoo Finance). In addition, there are third-party API providers which could offer extensive data sets including order book data and trade data, these companies are Coin API, CryptoDataDownload and Kaiko. These third-party companies usually charge fees for comprehensive data (Kaiko).

The time to set up the time series very well depend on the complexity of the Time series analysis. The installation and importing process of additional libraries such as, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib along with Python Pandas DataFrame if the process is required in order to read the CSV data file (Stojiljkovic), on the other hand the possibilities of API will require the Requests library (Pearson). The conditions of statistics and perhaps running a section for the Dicky-Fuller test in search for any unit root can aid the development of the program (Prabhakaran). Overall, the time it takes to create the time series analysis technique complies with familiarity of libraries and techniques. Moreover, the time required to produce the result is built on the complexity of the analysis performed and the size of the data implemented. There are various ways to optimize and create the algorithm efficiently such as specialized libraries for example, ARIMA (Hayes).

The output of the data will be prediction using previous data collected over a period of time. The time series output may include the future price of a cryptocurrency at a specific day, hour, and minute. A larger scale may include market capitalisation, expected highs and lows and trading volume. This could be displayed in a chart, graph or table which can be analysed internally for further implementation such as neural networks (Mandal).

### Feed-Forward Neural Network

There are multiple choices when it comes to data availability, multiple cryptocurrency exchanges offer API’s which the user can operate the data given such as, historical price, volume, open, close, high, low and many more dependant on the API of choice. Also, public dataset can also be obtained through CryptoDataDownload, this can be downloaded in a CSV format, however it could be useful to convert this into a JSON file depending on the approach of the project. If there are no options for a specific cryptocurrency dataset to be obtained, libraries such as, Beautiful Soup can aid the project by extracting data from HTML and XML documents. Websites which display a graph or chart of the desired cryptocurrency can then be modified and parse the data structure into Python (Breuss). Alternatively, if all options above is no longer a choice the use of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) could be useful, GAN has the ability to create synthetic data which could be similar to the data you’re looking for in a cryptocurrency, note GANs are typically used for training and testing machine learning, therefore it may not provide the optimal results the user is looking for (Brownlee).

The use of time to set up a Feed-forward neural network for cryptography depends on a number of factors. The time consumption of collecting and pre-processing the data would take a significant amount of time, on the other hand if the data is already collected and pre-processed using a library it should only take a few hours. The setup for feed-forward neural network may require using libraries such as, Tensorflow developed by Google or Pytorch developed by Facebook to allow the user to evaluate the data using image and video analytics (Kumar), dynamic graph for developers to change the models with ease (Dey). The time required to produce results will highly depend on the size and quality of the data, the number of layers and units in the network and the optimization of the algorithm used to train the model. A simple feed-forward neural network can be trained within a few hours, it is considered a fast and efficient approach to analyse future predictions, nonetheless larger datasets and complicated datasets may take a significantly longer time, this could vary from days to weeks (Turing). There are several touches which can be made to ensure the data is more accurate. Fine tuning the model is always required to ensure the results and performance will display more accurately and swiftly. There is also the aspect of the condition and processing power of the hardware machine, newly developed machine with higher processing power and graphical processing power with have an input to the development time of the output (Mohanan).

The output of the future price prediction of a cryptocurrency based on its historical data could vary from a single floating value using numeric value, a binary value or Boolean value, alternatively the model can also produce a direction of the crypto market price, this can then be evaluated using a graph or image and video analytics. The quality and accuracy of the Feed-forward Neural Network model will highly be based on the data sample, relevance of data and the optimisation of the model inserted to make predictions (Zhang, Feng, and Huang).

### Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is a NLP technique used to determine the behaviour of humans opinion, emotions and respected opinions and perceptions from high profiles of the field. The context of sentiment and cryptocurrency can be used to gain value of the public assessment to make trading decisions. There are several ways to apply sentiment analysis, this includes social media, news articles, trading data, blogs, and forums (Wang). For example, social media platforms including Twitter and Reddit has a far-reaching source of sentiments on cryptocurrency. Many high-profile personnel such as, Elon Musk has impacted the heights and downfall of cryptocurrency markets (Zeitchik). News articles have continuously covered the developments in the cryptocurrency sphere and it can also be valuable resource of sentiment, many developers have also included the usefulness of news articles accordingly towards their prediction. Blogs and forums dedicated to crypto may provide slightly more in-depth opinions, this can allow the sentiment analysis model to flourish and decide upon the advantages and disadvantages of a specific crypto market (Burnie, Yilmaz and Aste). Another great choice of sentiment analysis trading data, its essential to have a diverse dataset to improve upon the model. Sentiment alone cannot be the only factor to creating a prediction, it is wise to add financial analysis and trends to ensure the prediction is more accurate (LCX Team).

The use of sentiment analysis is fairly rapid as the model includes existing libraries such as, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) along with the vade_lexicon resource. The user can then use TwitterSearch to search for tweets for specific keywords for example, Bitcoin or Etherium and many other choices dependant on the user. Once the keywords are collected, the ability of NLTK’s Sentiment Intensity Analyzer can judge upon the sentiment of a single tweet, the output could contain negative, neutral, and positive counts for the tweet (Siklar). This can be replicated for news articles, blogs, and forums. Despite the swift process of gathering data, pre-processing data, selecting a model such as RoBERTa, GPT or BERT to fine tune the specific dataset and testing could take a significant amount of time (Rita). One of the main benefits of sentiment analysis in crypto is it can translate into further analysis for example, comparison with another crypto coin, tracking with news and evaluate the change of sentiments instantly therefore, results could differ very quickly.

The output of sentiment analysis can differ depending on the user’s implementation, one of the most common sentiment outputs is sentiment classification score, this suggests the outcomes of a certain crypto if it would be extremely positive, slightly positive, neutral, slightly negative, and extremely negative. Furthermore, some sentiment analysis tools may offer highlighted keywords used for the specific crypto coin (Gupta).

## Testing

The testing method chosen was using Automatic Time Series Forecasting also known as Auto-ARIMA, the ARIMA model consists of three parameters (p Autoregression, d integrated and q moving average) respectively. Finding the value is extremely time consuming especially the dataset provided in the CSV file included a year’s worth of data, therefore Auto-ARIMA automatically selects the best parameters using the ARIMA model using heuristics and statistical tests. The process begins with tests including the Augmented Dicky Fuller (ADF) test, Phillips-Perron (PP) test and several others to determine the (d) difference integration. It then uses the Autocorrelation function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation function (PACF) to determine the (p and q) parameters. Once the values are determined the Auto-ARIMA algorithm finds the best outcome to forecast future crypto prices by using the fit() function. In addition to the Auto-ARIMA test, I have implemented the Mean Squared error (MSE) and Mean Absolute error (MAE), this will give an indication of the accuracy of the model. The test for MSE came to 3518.135 and 37.542 for MAE, the lower the value the better, if the value is 0, the model is completely perfect with 100% correlation.
